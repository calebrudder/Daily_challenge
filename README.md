# Daily_challenge
This is a repository of my completion of the Dev.to "daily challenge" series

The people over at dev.to have created a "daily challenge" thread where they publish a small coding task in order to work on some basic programming skills. 

I am always wanting to keep my mind active and work on trivial tasks and build new skills or enforce old ones. 

This series was a great place to start for me, and I will be publishing my work as I go
